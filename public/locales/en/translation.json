    "list": [
      {
        "question": "What file formats do you accept/provide?",
        "answer": "We typically work with .STL, .OBJ, and .PLY files, but can discuss other formats if needed. We primarily deliver optimized .STL files ready for printing."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the turnaround time?",
        "answer": "Turnaround depends on the project complexity, object size, and required print time. Simple scans and prints can take a few days, while larger projects might take a week or more. We provide an estimate upon project review."
      },
      {
        "question": "What materials can you print with?",
        "answer": "We offer a range of FDM plastics like PLA, PETG, and ABS for durable parts, and standard resins for high-detail models. If you have specific material requirements (e.g., flexible, heat-resistant), let us know, and we can discuss options."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can you scan large objects or spaces?",
        "answer": "Yes, photogrammetry is versatile. We can scan objects ranging from small figurines to larger items like furniture. Scanning larger areas like rooms or building facades is possible but depends on the project scope and required detail level."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the accuracy of your scans and prints?",
        "answer": "Photogrammetry scanning accuracy depends on the object size and texture, typically within a millimeter range. FDM printing accuracy is usually around +/- 0.2mm, while resin printing offers higher precision, often below 0.1mm layer heights."
