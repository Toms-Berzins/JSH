# Social Media Strategy for Riga3D Solutions

## Overview

This document outlines the MVP social media strategy for Riga3D Solutions, focusing on building brand awareness, showcasing our 3D scanning and printing capabilities, and driving customer acquisition through a balanced approach to digital content.

## Strategic Approach

Rather than focusing on extensive blog content development, our strategy prioritizes:

1. **Visual-first social media presence** on platforms matching our target demographics
2. **Limited but high-value website content** (pillar pages for key services)
3. **Case study-driven content marketing** that can be repurposed across platforms

This approach aligns with our business goals of establishing Riga3D Solutions as the leading 3D scanning and printing service in the Latvian market while efficiently using our marketing resources.

## Case Study Framework

Case studies will form the core of our content marketing, with each study designed to be modular for use across both social media and the website.

4. Technical specifications
5. Client testimonial
6. Outcomes and benefits

Each case study will be:
- Published as a dedicated page on the website
- Condensed for LinkedIn articles
- Converted to carousel posts for Instagram
- Featured in portfolio section

## Cross-Platform Integration

To maximize content efficiency and maintain consistent messaging:

- Case studies will be adapted for both LinkedIn and Instagram with segment-appropriate messaging
- Website will include social proof from LinkedIn testimonials
- Instagram feed will be embedded on the website homepage
- Email signature will include social media links
- QR codes to social profiles will be included on business cards and promotional materials

## Multilingual Content Strategy

As a Baltic region business serving diverse language audiences, our social media content implements a strategic multilingual approach:

### Instagram Multilingual Strategy
- Primary captions in Latvian
- English translations included in the same post
- Russian language used in targeted Stories for specific segments
- Visual language indicators in post graphics where appropriate

### LinkedIn Multilingual Strategy
- Bilingual (Latvian/English) posts for maximum professional reach
- Industry-specific language targeting (English for medical/tech, Latvian for architecture/manufacturing)
- Professional translations rather than automated tools
- Consistent terminology across all platforms
