## Digital Marketing Strategy Update

Based on business requirements and resource optimization, we've pivoted from the original blog-focused content strategy to a more visual, social media-centric approach. This pivot includes:

- Prioritizing Instagram and LinkedIn as primary content distribution channels
- Developing core pillar pages for the website instead of an extensive blog
- Creating case studies as the central content format that can be repurposed across platforms

For comprehensive details on implementation, timelines, and KPIs, see the [Social Media Strategy Documentation](../technical/SOCIAL_MEDIA_STRATEGY.md).

## Multi-Language Support

Riga3D Solutions serves a diverse audience across the Baltic region, necessitating a robust multi-language approach. Our implementation includes:

- Full support for Latvian, English, and Russian languages
- Tiered translation strategy based on content priority
- Language-specific SEO optimization
- Integration with Localazy for translation management
- Consistent multilingual messaging across digital platforms

This approach ensures we effectively communicate with all audience segments while managing translation resources efficiently. For detailed implementation specifications, see our [Multi-Language Framework Documentation](../technical/MULTILINGUAL.md).
