# Project Context: Riga3D Solutions

## Business Overview

Riga3D Solutions is a small-scale 3D scanning, modeling, and printing service based in Riga, Latvia. The business uses photogrammetry-based 3D modeling (using Poly.cam) and desktop 3D printing technology to transform real-world objects and designs into precise 3D models and physical prototypes.

## Business Mission

The mission is to make 3D scanning and printing accessible and useful to a wide range of clients - from individuals and hobbyists to professionals in medical, architectural, and manufacturing fields. The goal is to bridge the gap between the physical and digital worlds by providing high-quality 3D models and printed prototypes quickly and affordably.

## Target Audience

The service targets five main customer segments:

1. **Individuals (consumers and hobbyists)**: Tech enthusiasts, makers, artists, and hobbyists who want to digitize and print personal items or artwork.

2. **Businesses (SMEs and designers)**: Small businesses and entrepreneurs in product design, marketing, or retail who need prototypes or scale models.

3. **Medical field**: Clinics, doctors, or health tech startups that can use anatomical models, medical device prototypes, or custom aids.

4. **Architecture and real estate**: Architects, structural engineers, and real estate developers who need physical scale models of buildings or interior spaces.

5. **Manufacturing and industry**: Local manufacturers, engineers, or craftspeople who need prototype development and reverse engineering.

## Core Services

1. **Photogrammetry-based 3D scanning**: Using Poly.cam and high-resolution smartphone cameras to capture objects or environments from multiple angles to create detailed digital 3D models.

2. **3D model creation and cleaning**: Processing and enhancing 3D models, including cleaning up scanning artifacts, filling holes, and optimizing the mesh for printing.

3. **3D printing (prototyping and models)**: Transforming 3D models into physical objects using FDM filament printers for durable parts and resin printers for high-detail parts.

4. **Post-processing and finishing**: Basic post-processing including support removal, rough edge sanding, and resin print curing/cleaning, as well as painting or surface finishing upon request.

5. **Mockup and prototype development**: Working as a partner in prototype development, including iterative scanning of hand-crafted mockups and printing refined versions.

## Competitive Landscape

The Latvian market has 3D printing services, but they typically focus on either high-end industrial production or niche areas. Riga3D Solutions stands out by offering comprehensive, small-scale solutions that combine photogrammetry-based 3D scanning with printing, which most local competitors don't provide under one roof.

## Business Goals

In the first year, the goal is to establish a stable client base in the local market and complete various trial projects in each target segment. The aim is to achieve monthly income through one-off projects and recurring business clients. Long-term goals include expanding capacity with additional equipment, forming strategic partnerships in key industries, and potentially serving clients throughout the Baltic region.

## Web Application Purpose

The website serves as the primary marketing and client acquisition tool for the business. It needs to:

1. Clearly communicate the services offered and their benefits
2. Showcase previous work in a portfolio
3. Explain the process from scan to print
4. Allow potential clients to calculate estimated costs
5. Provide answers to common questions
6. Make it easy to request services or get in touch
7. Establish credibility in the 3D printing and scanning field

The design should be professional, modern, and convey technical expertise while remaining approachable for clients from diverse backgrounds without technical knowledge of 3D technologies.

## Website Implementation

The website is built with modern web technologies and implements a comprehensive SEO strategy:

### Technical Implementation
- React 18 with TypeScript for robust, maintainable code
- Tailwind CSS for responsive, modern design
- Framer Motion for smooth animations and transitions
